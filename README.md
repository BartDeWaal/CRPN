# ERPN
*An RPN  calculator written in Python*

**This is not yet ready for use**
Keyboard shortcuts, layout and other major interface changes will still be made
without remorse.

The goal is to create a calculator that has a much easier and more usable
interface for "live" use than dc.

It's keyboard based, for fast use.

There is always a quick reference of the availble functions, so you can use it
for tasks you don't do every day.

It has strong undo functions and a clear overview of what is going on, so you
don't lose time on typos and mistakes.

## Instructions
To enter a negative number, you can start entry with an underscore ("_"). This
will be converted to a "-" in the interface.

Commands that are listed as starting with ! mean to combine with alt. So for
example "!m" means alt-m.

You can move a marker up and down using the arrows. You can then use t to copy
(take) that value to the end of the stack, or you can run any function to first
copy the selected item to the end of the stack and then run the function.

Use space or enter to copy either the last value or the value selected with the
cursor.
